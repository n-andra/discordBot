# discordBot

This discord bot was a project undertaken for fun and really to see if you had the skill to code a bot.

It kind of worked.

What worked was :
1. Bot can go online on discord
2. Bot can join voice channels on discord
3. Bot visibly *shows* voice activity

As it is I am stuck on one bit - actually having the bot play sound AFTER joining a discord vc.
