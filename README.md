# discordBot

This discord bot was a project undertaken for fun and really to see test my skills in coding a bot.

It kind of worked.

What worked was :
1. Bot can go online on discord
2. Bot can join voice channels on discord
3. Bot visibly *shows* voice activity

To be worked on:
1. Having the bot play sounds AFTER joining a discord vc.
2. Bot has additional functionalities - (playlists, meme posts, etc.)
